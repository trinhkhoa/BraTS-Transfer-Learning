# BraTS-Transfer-Learning
project name: Fine-tuning BraTS using U-Net model on other anatomical regions

brief description: Using fine-tuning on pre-trained model on brain tumor segmentation to apply it on other anatomical model and validate the model using Dice score

author information and contact: Khoa Trinh/ +1 (740)-915-2197

prerequisites (what software is needed? What versions? Require any special packages/libraries? anything paid?): None

data (description and citations/urls, maybe list key variables): The data was split into training dataset, testing dataset, and label for both. The dataset is in nz. tail, which requires NiBabel package in Python to read the input.

code (what code files exist? What does each do? Is there an order needed to run them?)...

any other useful information.
